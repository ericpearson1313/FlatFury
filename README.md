# FlatFury

My xilinx Artix-7 dev system for PCIe devlopment. It uses a LiteFury mounted to a raspberry Pi5 with M.2 slot.
I've incorporated my standard HDMI video output. I've brought up the pcie interface
without drivers directly accessing via: lspci, setpci, pcimem commands.

This repo builds upon the LiteFury basis but with a greatly simplified flat file hierarchy
